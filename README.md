## Building an API

API: Application Programming Interface

⸻

# Explanation
	•	Application: Any software that has a specific purpose.
	•	Programming: A set of rules (protocols) that dictate how two applications talk to each other using requests and responses.
	•	Interface: The point where two systems meet and interact — like the “middleman” that lets applications communicate smoothly.
 

Together, an API is simply a way for different systems or applications to communicate with each other.

# Scenario: Physical Library

CALL → Request → Response

API Explanation with Library Analogy:
	•	You (the user) walk into the library and make a request to find a specific book, like Harry Potter.
	•	The Library (API) takes your request and sends it to the “Book Database” (server) to check if it’s available.
	•	While the library (API) is checking, you might be put on hold (this is like waiting for the server to process your request).
	•	After a short wait, the library (API) comes back to you and says, “Yes, we have Harry Potter available!” (This is the response from the API with the data you requested).
	•	Now, you can go pick up the book (or, in API terms, the data you requested is now available for use!).

⸻

Key Points:
	•	Request: You ask for something (like a book or data).
	•	API (Library): The middleman that takes your request, talks to the database, and then brings the response back to you.
	•	Response: The library (API) gives you the answer, like confirming if the book is available or not.

# Technical Terms

Now, you want to figure out more information about this book, such as:
	•	How many copies of Harry Potter do they have?
	•	How many people have rated this book?
	•	Who is the author?
	•	Do they have the specific edition or title you requested?

 # What’s Next?

With an API, you can now build requests to get answers to questions like:
	•	How many copies of Harry Potter are available?
	•	How many people have rated this book?
	•	Who is the author?
	•	Do they have the specific edition or title you requested?

These requests would be sent to the API, and the API would respond with the exact data you need — all without you having to dig through the database yourself!
